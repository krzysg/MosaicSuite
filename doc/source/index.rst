**MosaicSuite** is a plugin for popular image processing software *ImageJ2* and *Fiji*.
It provides image-processing algorithms developed at the `MOSAIC group <https://mosaic.mpi-cbg.de>`_.
The first plugin which is now part of MosaicSuite was a popular 2D/3D single-particle tracking tool which can be used to track bright spots in 2D/3D movies over time. As more plugins have been added, we decided to provide them in a single, coherent package, which will also group them under a common menu point ``Plugins->Mosaic`` in ImageJ2 and Fiji.
