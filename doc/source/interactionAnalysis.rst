Interaction Analysis (IA)
=========================

The Interaction Analysis plugin (IA) can infer the spatial interaction between two point
patterns(sets of points).  These points can be locations of molecules, viruses, organelles,
cells, etc, in 2D or3D. Spatial interaction means the point patterns are correlated with
each other, and the absenceof this means they are independent of each other.
