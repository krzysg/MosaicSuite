PSF Measurement 2D/3D
=====================

With this tool you are able to estimate the PSF of a microscope setup and to compare it
to the theoretical PSF as calculated from elementary parameters of the microscope and
the camera.  This serves two purposes:  First, you might want to know whether you
adjusted your equipment optimally,  and second,  the PSF can be used for image restoration
purposes (in future versions of the plugin) such as deconvolution.
